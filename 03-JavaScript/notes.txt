Interview process:
- Every one is different. But in general: high-level cultural fit interview, behavior interview, technical interview.
- High-level; HR interview, high-level assessment that you know what you're talking about. Know enough and practice.
- Hiring manager; behavioral. Deeper technical questions. Theory and understanding of concepts.
- Technical: Likely will be presented with a problem you must solve. A lot of times will involve an algorithm.

Good way to practice coding thought process;
- Take a simple task and write detailed instructions for it, assuming that the reader knows nothing about the layout of the room.
- Like making a cup of coffee. 
- The computer knows nothing other than what you tell it to do.
- Reach out for help if you need it. This is a hard switch to start doing.

Conditional Statements:

var x = 50;
var expression1 = x < 25;
var expression2 = x > 50;

if (expression1 && expression2) {
    console.log
}
